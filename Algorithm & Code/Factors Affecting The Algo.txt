Factors Affecting The Algo

Data Sets Used:

Data sent to Disaster Cluster:
1) Zone ID
2) Time Period

Data Returned from Disaster Cluster:
1) Probability of a Disaster
2) Severity of the Disaster (Scale of 1 to 10)

Data sent to Rainfall Data Cluster:
1) Zone ID
2) Time Period

Data Returned from Rainfall Cluster:
1) Rainfall Scale (0 to 10, where 0 is drought & 10 is flood.)
2) Probability of the rainfall in the preffered time-period

Data Sent to FCI Cluster:
1) Zone ID

Data Returned from FCI CLuster:
1) Last year's Total stock of the particular grain
2) Last year's Stock left of the particular grain

3) Avg. Total stock of the particular grain in last years
4) Avg. Stock left of the particular grain in last years

5) Avg. Amount of grains exported in last years
6) Last year's Total Amount of grains exported

7) Avg. Amoun of grains kept in Emergency Stock
8) Last year's Emergency Stock

9) Grains used for Govt. purposes


// Algorithm

1) Stock reduced by Disasterous Factors.
2) Stock reduced by Govt. use.
3) Emergency Stock reduced by rainfall factors.
